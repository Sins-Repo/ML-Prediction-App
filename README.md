# A simple Machine Learning Prediction Application 
This project will demonstrate how a pickled machine learning algorithm can be used by a web application to perform prediction. The chosen dataset in this project is Iris dataset.

### Flask
A web framework written in Python

<br />

How to run this app
```
% cd <project directory>
% source env/bin/activate

% export FLASK_APP=sample
% export FLASK_ENV=development
% flask run
```

Enter 127.0.0.1:5000 in your browser tab and you will see the web app

<br />

How to quit this app
```
% ctrl + c
% deactivate 
```

## Output
Make prediction on a single instance
